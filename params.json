{"name":"WAPA","tagline":"A better way to see what your WildCARD can do for you","body":"![](http://gallardo1226.github.io)![](http://gallardo1226.github.io/browse.html)\r\nNorthwestern offers a website concerning the various WildCARD discounts available for students, faculty, and staff. However, not many people know about it, and even fewer use it. Furthermore, it's difficult to a hassle to use on mobile devices, where such a website is most useful. This makes it hard to know about available discounts, find nearby discounts when not at home, and remember to use discount when actually going somewhere.\r\n\r\nWe have built [mobile webapp](http://gallardo1226.github.io/) that streamlines the process of discovering and finding discounts. You can now look at a map of participating businesses near your current location, browse and filter all participating businesses by various categories, set a reminder to use a discount somewhere, and set favorites so that they can be easily accessed later.\r\n\r\nSome features of our app aren't fully functional yet, sorry!\r\n\r\nThanks for trying our app, and we hope you'll find it useful.\r\n\r\n-Team Pterodactyl","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
