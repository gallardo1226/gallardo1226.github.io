Northwestern offers a website concerning the various WildCARD discounts available for students, faculty, and staff. However, not many people know about it, and even fewer use it. Furthermore, it's difficult to a hassle to use on mobile devices, where such a website is most useful. This makes it hard to know about available discounts, find nearby discounts when not at home, and remember to use discount when actually going somewhere.</p>

<p>We have built <a href="http://gallardo1226.github.io/">mobile webapp</a> that streamlines the process of discovering and finding discounts. You can now look at a map of participating businesses near your current location, browse and filter all participating businesses by various categories, set a reminder to use a discount somewhere, and set favorites so that they can be easily accessed later.</p>

<p>Some features of our app aren't fully functional yet, sorry!</p>

<p>Thanks for trying our app, and we hope you'll find it useful.</p>
